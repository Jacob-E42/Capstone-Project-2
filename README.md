# Capstone-Project-2

The app is a journaling app for beginners designed to help users build a daily journaling habit with the help of AI feedback. The app features user registration and login, the ability to submit journal entries and track streaks, and AI feedback on journal entries to help users improve their writing skills. The app also incorporates an external API for sentiment analysis to provide additional insights into users' journal entries.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, simply sign up for an account on the app's homepage. Once you've logged in, you can submit journal entries, track your streaks, and receive AI feedback on your writing. The app is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, even for users who are new to journaling.

## Prerequisites

the app is built using React and Node.js, so you'll need to have these technologies installed on your computer in order to run the app locally. You'll also need to create an account with the external API provider in order to access the sentiment analysis features.

## Installation

To install the app, simply clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. You'll also need to set up your local environment with the required credentials for the external API.

## Usage

To use the app, simply start the app by running `npm start` and navigate to the app's homepage in your web browser. From there, you can create a new account or log in to an existing account, submit journal entries, track your streaks, and receive AI feedback on your writing.
