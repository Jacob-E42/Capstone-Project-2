## Description

Inkling is an intuitive journaling app crafted to assist beginners in developing a consistent journaling routine, enhanced by the support of AI-driven feedback. This user-friendly platform offers a seamless process for users to create daily journal entries. It further enhances the journaling experience by allowing users to choose the type of entry they wish to compose. A standout feature of Inkling is its integration with OpenAI's advanced AI, which provides constructive and encouraging feedback on each entry, aiding users in honing their writing skills. Additionally, Inkling utilizes an external API for sentiment analysis, offering users a unique perspective on their writing by generating insightful emotion-based charts. This blend of features makes Inkling not just a journaling tool but a journey towards self-improvement and emotional awareness.

Inkling is developed using a combination of popular and practical technologies. The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, providing a straightforward and effective server setup. For the frontend, we've used React.js and JavaScript, aiming for a user-friendly interface. The application integrates IBM's Natural Language Understanding API and OpenAI's Chat API for enhanced language processing capabilities. Testing is handled using the Jest library, and for data storage, we rely on a PostgreSQL database.
