# Inkling

Inkling is a journaling app for beginners designed to help users build a daily journaling habit with the help of AI feedback. Inkling features user registration and login, the ability to submit journal entries and track streaks, and AI feedback on journal entries to help users improve their writing skills. Inkling also incorporates an external API for sentiment analysis to provide additional insights into users' journal entries.
